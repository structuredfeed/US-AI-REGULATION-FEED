# Product SKU Declaration

This repository represents a jurisdiction-scoped dataset that conforms to a shared, locked metadata schema.

Each jurisdictional dataset is offered as an independent SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) while maintaining full structural compatibility with other regional datasets.

## SKU Scope

- This repository contains data for a single jurisdiction only.
- The schema, governance, and methodology are identical across all SKUs.
- Datasets may be combined across jurisdictions without transformation.

## Available SKUs

- SKU-US — United States AI regulatory and legislative feed
- SKU-UK — United Kingdom AI regulatory and legislative feed
- SKU-EU — European Union AI regulatory and legislative feed

## Interoperability
All SKUs:
- Share an identical schema
- Use consistent relevance classification rules
- Follow identical versioning and governance policies

This enables:
- Regional deployment
- Multi-jurisdictional aggregation
- Enterprise-grade compliance integration
